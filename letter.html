                    You give your shoppers the option to find out <br>
                    what size of the item they intend to buy, will <br>
                    make the best fit. <br><br>
                    The only question the shoppers are asked is <br>
                    "what is your favourite garment of a given <br>
                    type and what size is it?"
                </p1>
                <p2>
                    If their favourite <br>
                    items aren't already <br>
                    in our database, they <br>
                    simply open the Fitly.ai <br>
                    Scanner on their <br>
                    phone, snap a photo <br>
                    of their favourite <br>
                    item laying flat on <br>
                    the floor and confirm.

                    It's said that <highlight>33%</highlight> of all shopping carts in <br>
                    fashion ecommerce are abandoned due to <br>
                    size uncertainty. <br><br>
                    On average, <highlight>22%</highlight> of all online clothing <br>
                    purchases are returned due to wrong size. <br>
                    This is a huge loss for you, your shoppers <br>
                    and your suppliers. <br><br>
                    We aim at recovering <highlight>1/3</highlight> of it for you <br>
                    in the first six months of using Fitly.ai,<br>
                    by giving your shoppers an easy tool <br>
                    that helps them make good decisions.

                    First of all, you pay only for the cases in which <br>
                    Fitly.ai really helped. To get started, we <br>
                    need to get you onboard properly. Although, <br>
                    we have a streamlined progress model, we want <br>
                    to learn about your business, your processes, <br>
                    constraints and resources to develop an <br>
                    individualised way to get to a point where you <br>
                    really can tell us that your business is <br>
                    benefiting from Fitly.ai just as expected.<br><br>
